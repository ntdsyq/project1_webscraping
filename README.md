In this project I created an R Shiny app visualization for personal healthcare expenditure data (source: cms.gov) at national (1960-2017) and state level (1991-2014). The user can explore personal healthcare spending trends over time, by category of spending and source of funding. Those trends are the result of changes in social-economical conditions and policy. 
On the national charts, the impact of healthcare programs and policies such as medicare, medicaid and the Affordable Care Act on healthcare spending can be clearly discerned.
On the US map showing spending by state, one would be able to easily identify states that are spending the most / least on healthcare per capita, and how each state's spending evolved over time.
