Scraped ratings and physician profiles from healthgrades.com for all gastroenterologists and cardiologists in metro NYC. Explored rating distributions, the relationships between the doctor's rating and the # of reviews, the doctor's age and gender, and office staff performance. 

### Conclusions: 
* What healthgrades has done is a great effort, but the current data collected have a number of potential caveats
  * Ratings heavily tilted toward the higher end and lack dynamic range (does this reflect a selection bias in which patients are more likely to submit a review?)
  * The way search result is ordered by “best match” may promote rich-gets-richer does not help generate reviews more evenly across the physician universe
* GI doctors in NYC metro with different length of time in practice are perceived similarly by patients in terms of bedside matter and quality of interaction
* Female GI specialists have much lower visibility on healthgrades as reflected by the smaller number of reviews, but their ratings do not differ from the male doctors
* Overall physician rating is primarily driven by doctor’s own performance. Negative experience with the office staff can bring down the overall rating while positive experience generally does not lift the overall rating
Analysis of the data for cardiologists leads to similar conclusions.
